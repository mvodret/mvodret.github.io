## About

I am a researcher working at the intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and complex systems.
I study how patterns and collective behaviors emerge in biological, social, and financial systems using data-driven and theoretical modeling.
My experience spans network theory, agent-based modeling, time-series analysis, and medical data.
I aim to build tools that connect theory and real-world data, turning complex dynamics into actionable insight.


## Research Interests


- Statistical mechanics and stochastic modeling

- Complex systems and emergent dynamics

- Time-series analysis and irreversibility

- Network theory and information flow

- Computational models for biology and society
