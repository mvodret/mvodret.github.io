## Teaching Philosophy

I believe in **hands-on, project-based learning** that connects theoretical concepts with real-world applications. My approach emphasizes:

- **Active Learning**: Students learn best by doing, not just listening
- **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Showing how physics principles apply across fields
- **Computational Literacy**: Integrating programming as a fundamental skill
- **Research Integration**: Bringing current research questions into the classroom
